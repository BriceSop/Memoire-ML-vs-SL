# MÃ©moire Machine Learning versus Statistical Learning
## *Description*
A Thesis focused on the study the behavior of different Machine Learning algorithms (Lasso, LAR, Elastic-net) and Statistical Learning algorithms (Stepwise, Forward/Backward) in terms of variable selection within a model, to put their strengths and weaknesses into perspective according to several statistical criteria (AIC, BIC, Cross Validation, etc) and different datasets.
This study is divided into 3 parts essentially: 
- The first one draws up a theoretical review of the algorithms, the statistical criteria, and other fundamental concepts.
- The second part presents the different datasets and the results obtained for each algorithm according to the criteria.
- The last part is an empirical analysis, using the Wisconsin Diabetes dataset.

The datasets used in the second part are generated by ourselves.
